            <p>
            1) In your own words, describe what event driven programming is. What event handler was used in the I Have a Dream app? How was it used? <br>
            Event driven programming is when you develop something that responds to user interactions using things like conditional statements. We used the when clicked event handler to detect when a user wanted to play or pause a sound. 
            <br>
            <br>
            2) Is it possible to create an app without event driven programming? Explain. <br>
            If you were to make an app without events, there would be no interaction. It would basically just be there to see. 
            <br>
            <br>
            3) What elements and components make up the User Interface (UI) for the I Have A Dream app? <br>
            A title and a picture of MLK.
            <br>
            <br>
            4) What are some of the elements that make up the UI for a car? A vending machine? <br>
            Some of the elements that make up the user interface for a car would be the seats, steering wheel, pedals and the speedometer. For a vending machine, there would be visible goods, buttons and a way to pay.

            <h2>2.3 - Algorithm Basics</h2>
            <p>
                1) (POGIL) Write an algorithm using the 4 simple commands to navigate the robot through the maze in the POGIL question listed in your online textbook.<br>
                MOVE_FORWARD<br>
                MOVE_FORWARD<br>
                ROTATE_RIGHT<br>
                MOVE_FORWARD<br>
                MOVE_FORWARD<br>
                MOVE_FORWARD<br>
                MOVE_FORWARD<br>
                ROTATE_LEFT<br>
                MOVE_FORWARD
                <br>
                <br>
                2) (POGIL) Write an algorithm using repetition control structures to navigate the robot through the maze referenced above.<br>
                REPEAT 2 times<br>
                    MOVE_FORWARD<br>
                ROTATE_RIGHT<br>
                REPEAT 4 times<br>
                    MOVE_FORWARD<br>
                ROTATE RIGHT<br>
                REPEAT 2 TIMES<br>
                    MOVE_FORWARD
                    <br>
                    <br>
                3) (POGIL) Include a description or a photo of your drawing of a maze that the general algorithm in the POGIL exercise CANNOT solve.<br>
                Since the robot can move anywhere, there would have to be something blocking the robot from reaching the goal. 
                <br>
                <br>
                4) (POGIL) Write an algorithm for washing a stack of 10 items that are cups and dishes mixed together, where the rule is that cups are washed in hot water and dishes in cold water. Use simple commands like hot_wash and cold_wash. You may also use the control structures IF and REPEAT n times. Identify the parts of your algorithm that are examples of Sequence, Selection and Repetition.<br>
                
                REPEAT 10 times (repetition)<br>
                    IF cup (selection)<br>
                        hot_wash (sequence)<br>
                    IF dish (selection)<br>
                        cold_wash (sequence)

            <h2>2.4 - I Have A Dream, Part 2</h2>
            <p>
                1) What components make up the User Interface (UI) for this enhanced version of the I Have A Dream app?<br>
                We mainly had pictures of MLK and Malcolm X and instructions on how to use the app. 
                <br>
                <br>
                2) A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function. We've just created a mobile app, which is certainly an example of a computing innovation.
                Give at least 3 examples from your own experience of computing innovations that you've used or seen and describe the function/purpose of each. <br>
                I have played video games which are an example of computing innovations. They are meant to entertain you. I have also used google chrome, which is a search engine you can use to browse the internet. Lastly, I have used youtube which is a site for watching and uploading videos.

            <h2>2.5 - Mobile Devices and Apps: Hardware and Software</h2>
            <p>
                1) Which hardware and software component(s) do you feel least confident describing? <br>
                I feel confident with describing pretty much everything. 
                <br>
                <br>
                2) Give an example of a special purpose computer that you are familiar with or use in your everyday life and what problem it addresses for you. <br>
                A special purpose computer that I use often is my calculator. It helps me solve complex math problems that I can not do mentally. 
                <br>
                <br>
                3) Explain in your own words the difference between running your app by "Connecting to the Companion" and running your app by "Packaging" it. <br>
                “Connecting to the Companion” will send the code to the device which will interpret the code and run the program. “Packaging” it will translate the entire program to a binary code file. 
                <br>
                <br>
                4) As we learned in this lesson, a byte is about the same amount of memory as a character, such as the letter 't'. There are approximately 7 million characters in all of the Harry Potter novels combined. How many bytes of memory would all of the Harry Potter novels take up? How many copies of the Harry Potter novels would fit on a 7 Gigabyte flash drive. (Remember 1 Gigabyte is 1 billion bytes.) <br>
                All the Harry Potter novels would take up 7 million bytes (7 megabytes). A 7 Gigabyte flash drive would hold 1000 copies of all the Harry Potter novels.

            <h2>2.6- The Internet and the Cloud</h2>
            <p>
            1) In your own words, give a sentence that would explain to a friend the difference between the WWW and the Internet. <br>
            The WWW is a collection of data in web pages and other related things. The internet is a connection between computers throughout the world. 
            <br>
            <br>
            2) (POGIL) List a beneficial effect and a harmful effect for a social media app that you discussed in your POGIL group. Are the effects on society, culture, or economics? Include a screenshot of the Venn diagram you made with your group. <br>
            Social media makes it easy to find people and communicate but it can be harmful because you may not know these people in real life and what their intentions are. I think the effects are on society, culture and economics but mainly on society. 
            </p>

            <p>
            3) (POGIL) If you were a developer of one of the social media apps that you discussed, how would you reduce the harmful effects? <br>
            I would make sure to alert the user what information they are putting out there and tell them who can access their information before they do things.

            <h2>2.7 - I Have a Dream and Soundboard Projects</h2>
            <p>
                1) Paste a link (or embed) the video you created for your Soundboard App. <br>
                <iframe src="soundboard.mp4" width="500px" height="300px"></iframe> <br>
                2) Describe the functionality of your soundboard app shown in your video. <br>
                We have 5 buttons that play and pause our individual sounds. We also have a randomizer button that plays a random sound. 
                <br>
                <br>
                3) Describe the purpose of your app. Why did you create it and how does it allow you to express yourself? <br>
                The purpose of the app is to play sounds from discord. We created it because both of us use discord pretty often. 
                <br>
                <br>
                4) Create a 3x3 table that includes two UI components in your app, the event handler used for each component, and the functionality the component contributes to your program. <br>
                <img src="3x3table.png" width="500px"> <br>
                5) Reflect with your partner on a difficulty you had with coding this app. How did collaboration help you overcome the challenge? <br>
                I believe the hardest part was coming up with the theme for the sounds. We both brainstormed ideas and picked the best one.

            <h2>2.8 What is Abstraction?</h2>
            <p>
                1) Write an explanation of abstraction, including at least one example, in your own words. <br>
                Abstraction is generalizing a complex idea to make things easier and more efficient. An example of an abstraction would be a variable. 
                <br>
                <br>
                2) Give 3 examples of abstractions in everyday life not identified in the lecture. <br>
                People, food, houses. 
                <br>
                <br>
                3) Identify a specific example of software, a mobile application, or a website and explain how it is an abstraction. <br>
                A calculator is an abstraction because it is generalizing things that can make calculations and it does not go into the very specifics of what exactly it does.

            4b) Summarize the article in a few sentences. <br>
            It first talks about how much social media is used. Then it talks about how it makes it very easy to communicate and learn. Then it goes on to talk about how it can cause problems like self-image ones.

            <br>
            4c) Is the computing innovation itself positive or negative? Explain your answer. <br>
            I think social media itself is positive because it was developed to be a useful innovation. It is just that there are some bad people out there. 
            <br>
            <br>
            4d) How have people used the computing innovation in positive and/or negative ways? <br>
            People nowadays use it to communicate easily. There are some people out there that use it to trick/scam people, which is a negative thing.
